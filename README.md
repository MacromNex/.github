# Biomolecular-Design-Nexus 🧬

**Developing the next generation of computational tools for biomolecular engineering.**

The **Biomolecular-Design-Nexus** is a research-driven GitHub organization focused on the intersection of Geometric Deep Learning, Molecular Physics, and Synthetic Biology. Our mission is to maintain a unified ecosystem for State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods while pioneering novel solutions for the most challenging problems in biomolecular design.

## 🏗️ The MCP Framework
We organize our research and implementations into **Multi-constraint/Method Platforms (MCPs)**. Each repository is designed to be a "one-stop shop" for a specific molecular modality, integrating existing SOTA models with our in-house innovations.



### 🧪 [ProteinMCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/ProteinMCP)
*Comprehensive design platform for proteins, enzymes, and antibodies.*
* **Enzyme Design:** Optimization for catalytic turnover ($k_{cat}$), thermostability, and regioselectivity.
* **Antibody Engineering:** Deep learning pipelines for CDR generation, paratope-epitope matching, and affinity maturation.
* **Peptide Binders:** Designing high-affinity binders for protein-protein interactions (PPIs).
* **Core Tech:** Diffusion models, ProteinMPNN, and ESM-based folding.

### 🧬 [NucleicMCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/NucleicMCP)
*Advanced tools for designing functional and structural nucleic acids.*
* **RNA Design:** 3D structure-to-sequence design for functional RNAs and aptamers.
* **DNA Nanotechnology:** Computational tools for structural DNA design and synthetic promoter engineering.
* **Complexes:** Modeling and designing Protein-RNA/DNA interfaces.

### 💍 [CycPepMCP](https://github.com/Biomolecular-Design-Nexus/CycPepMCP)
*Specialized research on constrained macrocycles and cyclic peptides.*
* **Geometric Constraints:** Solving the unique challenges of macrocyclization via equivariant graph neural networks.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Designing for membrane permeability and metabolic stability.
* **Novel Methods:** Tackling the conformational sampling problem for cyclic structures using generative AI.

## 🔬 Core Research Pillars
Beyond implementation, the Nexus is dedicated to solving "Unsolved Problems" in the field:

1.  **Zero-Shot Design:** Moving beyond template-based design to create functional molecules for entirely novel targets.
2.  **Multi-Modal Modeling:** Designing systems where proteins, DNA, and small molecules interact within a single framework.
3.  **Multi-Property Optimization:** Optimization.
