# Macromolecular Nexus 🧬

**A unified ecosystem for macromolecular design tools and automated workflows.**

The **Macromolecular Nexus (MacromNex)** is a research-driven GitHub organization focused on the intersection of Geometric Deep Learning, Molecular Physics, and Synthetic Biology. Our mission is to maintain a unified ecosystem for State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods while pioneering novel solutions for the most challenging problems in macromolecular design.
